# RustUpgrader
## A simple program for optimizing the game Rust

Since Facepunch didn't bother to do a proper memory cleanup, this program will fix that. It automatically optimizes the Rust game, by:

* Using a newer DirectX
* Cleaning up unused memory
* And other things

## How to use:
1. Download last build from releases
2. Launch app
3. Click button "Optimize"

## Additionally
The project is still under development, so if you find a bug, report it to issues!

## Expect new updates!
